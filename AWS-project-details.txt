project 3:
AWS HealthCare Project

overview:
“I designed a hospital notification system using AWS.
I created a custom VPC using CloudFormation, launched an EC2 instance inside it, and used Amazon SNS to send notifications to patients.
The system follows least-privilege IAM access, uses CloudWatch for monitoring, and all resources are cleaned up properly to avoid unnecessary costs.”

architecture:
“I used CloudFormation to create a VPC with subnets,IGW and route tables.
An EC2 instance runs inside the VPC and publishes messages to an SNS topic to notify patients.
IAM roles are attached to the EC2 instance so it can publish to SNS securely without access keys.
CloudWatch is used to monitor SNS metrics and EC2 logs.”

Why did you use SNS?
“SNS is a fully managed messaging service.
It is scalable, reliable, and supports multiple subscribers like email, SMS, or Lambda.
In my project, SNS is used to send notifications to patients without managing any messaging servers.”

why not email directly from EC2: “SNS is more reliable and decoupled.
It allows multiple subscribers and retries automatically, unlike direct email sending.”

Security explanation:
“For security, I used IAM roles instead of access keys on EC2.
The role has only SNS publish permission, following the principle of least privilege.
Security groups restrict inbound and outbound traffic at the VPC level.”

Monitoring & logging question

If they ask “How did you monitor it?”:
“SNS provides CloudWatch metrics like number of messages published and delivery success.
Since SNS does not generate logs by default, Lambda can be added if message-level logging is required.”

Cost & free-tier awareness:
“I ensured the project stays within free tier by avoiding NAT Gateway and Load Balancers.
After testing, I cleaned up all resources using CloudFormation to avoid unexpected charges.”

issue you faced in this project:
“While deleting the CloudFormation stack, the VPC deletion failed because a manually created security group still existed.
CloudFormation only deletes resources it manages.
After deleting the manual security group, the stack deletion succeeded.”

What would you improve?
“In a real production system, I would add Lambda for message logging, enable encryption using KMS, use private subnets with NAT Gateway, and add alarms in CloudWatch for failure notifications.”

One-line resume version:	“Built an AWS-based hospital notification system using CloudFormation, EC2, SNS, IAM, and CloudWatch with secure access control and cost-optimized architecture.”
